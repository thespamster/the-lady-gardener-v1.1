# Tracey the Gardengal v1.1

This is a revised version of my first ever website build. The remit was to build a 3-page minimum site using HTML and CSS. I have now redesigned and rebuilt the site from the ground up. This will be deployed as my wife's new gardening site.

The main changes from the original build are:

- A single page site with distinct parts rather than a 4-page site.
- Bootstrap carousels replace both the plant gallery and the garden gallery.
- The Facebook and Instagram icons are now embedded in the main body of the site rather than being in the footer. The email icon is reduced in size.
- A much smaller footer with a flowers icon behind it to the right makes for a cleaner look at the bottom of the page.

## Technologies Used

- Bootstrap v5 CSS & Javascript library [Bootstrap v5.3 - CSS library](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- To create the favicon for the title bar, [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/)
- Custom Google fonts [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Media

- All images used were shot on my wife's iPhone 11
- Credit to [Freepik at Flaticons.com](https://www.flaticon.com) for the Facebook, Instagram, Email and flower icons. Check them out. Awesome icons for free!
